# Phase 1 Research Portal
# 🧠 Your Daily-Life Problem Matters

Welcome to **problem2project-ai**, a student-led, research-driven initiative aimed at turning everyday challenges into impactful final-year engineering projects. This portal serves as **Phase-1**: an idea collection interface built to gather real-world inputs from students for data-driven AI development.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Collect authentic personal experiences and student challenges
- Analyze submissions using NLP techniques to surface common themes
- Use insights to brainstorm meaningful final-year project ideas
- Build inclusive tools and prototypes guided by real user needs

---

## 📊 Research Methodology

- 💬 **Input Source**: Structured Google Form linked via a modern HTML interface  
- 🤖 **Processing**: NLP-based clustering, keyword extraction, sentiment analysis  
- 📈 **Visualization**: Tableau dashboards for data storytelling and insight mapping  
- 🧪 **Tools**: Python, Streamlit, GitHub, and collaborative design platforms
